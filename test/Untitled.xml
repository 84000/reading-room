In this sūtra Śāriputra approaches Maitreya and requests him to explain the meaning of the following statement of the Buddha, which he had made earlier that same day while gazing at a rice seedling: “Whoever sees dependent arising sees the Dharma. Whoever sees the Dharma sees the Buddha.” What follows is an explanation of dependent arising through the twelve links, the eightfold path of the noble ones, and their relation to outer and inner causes and conditions. Crucially, it is by understanding the very nature of dependent arising that one can be free from it and attain enlightenment.</p>  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="node-4" class="glossarize">

However, it is quoted extensively in surviving Sanskrit treatises like Yaśomitra’s <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Abhi­dharma­kośa­vyākhyā</span>, Candrakīrti’s <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Prasannapadā</span>, Prajñākaramati’s <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Bodhi­caryāvatāra­pañjikā</span>, Śāntideva’s <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Śikṣasamuccaya</span>, and also a critical non-Buddhist treatise, the <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Bhāmatī</span> by Vācaspatimiśra. Mainly based on these, several Sanskrit reconstructions have been carried out which are claimed to include about ninety percent of <span class="text-en glossarize-complete title">The Rice Seedling</span>. The first reconstructed edition was prepared by Louis de La Vallée Poussin (1913). Without having access to this, N. Ayaswami Sastri (1950) produced another reconstruction. Another one was produced by V.V. Gokhale (1961). Finally, a thorough comparative study and new reconstructed edition was carried out by N. Ross Reat (1993), taking into account Sanskrit, Tibetan, Pāli, and Chinese sources; Reat also provides a complete English translation. This work also illustrates the many parallel and similar passages in Pāli suttas. </p>  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="node-5" class="glossarize">

These works have been thoroughly studied and translated by Jeffrey D. Schoening (1995). He also gives a chronological account of both partial and complete Western language translations of <span class="text-en glossarize-complete title">The Rice Seedling</span>, the first <span class="ignore">being</span> a translation from the Chinese into Italian in 1908; and he mentions a Japanese translation from the Chinese of Taishō 709. </p>  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="node-6" class="glossarize">

A very similar sūtra (Taishō 708) had already been translated by Chih-ch’ien in the Wu Dynasty (222–280 CE). As Martin (2014, p. 283) has noted, the <span class="text-en glossarize-complete title">Testament of Wa / Ba</span> (<span class="text-wy glossarize-complete title">dba’</span> / <span class="text-wy glossarize-complete title">sba bzhed</span>) mentions that a Chinese version was translated into Tibetan before the completion of the first monastery of Tibet, Samye, toward the end of the eighth century. The Tibetan translation is also mentioned in the Denkarma (<span class="text-wy glossarize-complete title">ldan dkar ma</span>) catalogue compiled by Kawa Paltseg et al., probably in the year 812. The colophons in two of the oldest surviving Tibetan manuscripts identified so far (the Dunhuang manuscripts PT 551 and PT 552), credit Yeshé Dé, a famous Tibetan translator of the eighth to ninth centuries, as the translator. This information is absent in the later editions. </p>  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="node-8" class="glossarize">

Variant readings as well as references to the commentaries are only given for passages that were crucial for essential decisions made with regard to the translation. Thus this translation does not aim to improve on the studies mentioned above. Readers who are interested in academic and philological research on the available textual sources may refer to them. What is intended here is a translation that is mainly based on the Tibetan version in the Degé Kangyur <span class="ignore">collection</span> and the Pedurma (<span class="text-wy glossarize-complete title">dpe bsdur ma</span>) comparative edition of the Kangyur, with reference to available Sanskrit materials, particularly Reat’s edition. </p>  </introduction>

It is as follows. From a seed comes a sprout, from a sprout a leaf, from a leaf a stem, from a stem a pedicel, from a pedicel a pistil, from a pistil a flower, and from a flower comes a fruit. If there is no seed, the sprout cannot arise and so on, until finally, without the flower, the fruit cannot arise.

            <note index="1" uid="UT22084-062-010-4">Edgerton, Gokale, Reat, and Sastri all record the spelling of <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">stamba</span> (seedling) in the title <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa title">śālistamba</span>, rather than the more common <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">stambha</span>. Monier-Williams lists <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">stamba</span> as “prob. a phonetic variation of <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">stambha</span>.” Among the versions of the Tibetan translation consulted, all read <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">stambha</span> with the exception of Yonglé and Peking, which read <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">stamba</span>. The Tibetan translations of the three Indian commentaries read <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">stamba</span>.</note>
            <note index="2" uid="UT22084-062-010-13">The term translated here is <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">sūtra</span> (Tibetan <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">mdo</span>). In Indian literature a <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">sūtra</span> generally refers to the statement of a short rule or universal truth, e.g. an axiom, dictum, formula, or thread. A collection of such statements can also be called a sūtra. While, generally speaking, Buddhist sūtras present a complete speech of the Buddha including introductory and concluding statements, here we have a complete teaching of the Buddha in very few words but still resembling the general usage of the term.</note>
            <note index="3" uid="UT22084-062-010-14"> Owing to the multivalence of the term <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharma</span> / <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">chos</span> and the play between these different senses witnessed in this text, we have chosen to leave it untranslated as <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharma</span> / <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">Dharma</span> in certain passages. Where we do render it into English, explanatory notes are provided.</note>
            <note index="4" uid="UT22084-062-010-15">The Sanskrit reads <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">bhagavatā</span> (Reat 1993, p. 27).</note>
            <note index="5" uid="UT22084-062-010-17"> A common name variant of Śāriputra. However, the Sanskrit (Reat, p. 28) and the Stok Palace version of the Tibetan (F.282b.6) both read Śāriputra. </note>
            <note index="6" uid="UT22084-062-010-18"> This entire sentence is missing from the available Sanskrit materials and the Chinese translation (Reat, pp. 28–29). </note>
            <note index="7" uid="UT22084-062-010-22"> “All dharmas” here has the sense of “all phenomena.” We leave the term untranslated here and throughout this passage to help convey the chain of associations communicated in the Sanskrit and Tibetan source texts through these uses of the multivalent term <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharma</span> / <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">chos</span>. See the following note, and note 12 for more on this multivalence. </note>
            <note index="8" uid="UT22084-062-010-23"> “Body of Dharma” here renders <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">chos kyi sku</span>. This section of the sūtra is not attested in the available Sanskrit material, so the available Sanskrit editions have actually been reconstructed from the Tibetan translation. Louis de La Vallée Poussin (1913, p. 72) and Sastri (1950, p. 3) reconstruct <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">chos kyi sku</span> here with <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharmakāya</span>, but we prefer—with Reat (p. 30)—the term <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharmaśarīra</span> because it is attested as a possible underlying Sanskrit term for the Tibetan <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">chos kyi sku</span> in the next paragraph (cf. Reat, p. 32 n5). Kamalaśīla interprets the term as the pristine wisdom, or suchness, that serves as a basis for the dharmas (i.e., awakened qualities) of a buddha. He states: “ ‘body of Dharma’ demonstrates the cause: that which serves as the cause of the dharmas (i.e., awakened qualities) of a buddha is pristine wisdom or pristine suchness—the body which is the body of Dharma” (Schoening, vol. 2, p. 473). Reat (ibid.) translates this term as “Dharma-body,” whereas Schoening (vol. 1, p. 237) renders it as “the body consisting of dharma(s).” As indicated by these different interpretations, the semantic range of the term <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharmaśarīra</span> (<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">chos kyi sku</span>) can include the interlinked notions of the “corpus” of the Buddha’s “teachings” or “doctrine” (Dharma), the “collection” of undefiled “qualities” (dharmas) that make a buddha a buddha, the physical body of the Buddha as an “embodiment” of “ultimate reality” (Dharma) and attendant “awakened qualities,” and, by extension, as Kamalaśīla’s interpretation suggests, the ethereal “body” of pristine wisdom that characterizes the Buddha’s awakening experience. The mutual implications of dharma as “doctrine,” “qualities,” and “reality” (and “phenomena” in general) is an important facet of the term’s multivalence in Buddhist literary sources. For more on the shifting semantic range of the terms <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharma</span>, <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharmaśarīra</span>, and <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharmakāya</span>, see Paul Harrison (1992). We have partially followed Reat in rendering this term with the slightly ambiguous “body of Dharma,” with the hope of not overly constraining the broad semantic range of the term and its possible commentarial interpretations.</note>
            <note index="9" uid="UT22084-062-010-24"> Dharmas (<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">chos rnams</span>) here seems to have the dual sense of “trainings” on the path and their associated “attainments” or “qualities” of attainment. Reat (p. 31) interprets dharmas here to mean only “rules, practices,” but this would not apply to “those beyond training.” </note>
            <note index="10" uid="UT22084-062-010-26"> We opted to interpret this passage according to Kamalaśīla’s commentary: “It is constant because it has been taught as a dharma that is thus unborn in all times. This shows that since the three times too are ultimately of one taste, it is unchanging (<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa title">Śālistamba</span>[<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa title">ka</span>]<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa title">ṭīkā</span>, p. 395: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">dus thams cad du ’di ltar skye ba med pa’i chos gsungs pa dang ldan pas na rtag pa’o/ /’dis ni dus gsum yang don dam par ro gcig pas ’gyur ba med par bstan to/</span>).” However, the Sanskrit versions also allow another interpretation by which “permanent / always / constant” (<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">satatasamitam</span>) qualifies “without life force” (<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">ajīvam</span> / <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">nirjīvam</span>), thus meaning, “always without life force.” This is also supported by the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa title">Śālistambaṭīkā</span> ascribed to Nāgarjuna (p. 805). Reat (pp. 32–33) translates this passage with “always and ever devoid of soul,” and he translates from the Chinese (Taishō 709) with “eternal, continuously arising without soul.” Note also the very similar passage at 1.59.</note>
            <note index="11" uid="UT22084-062-010-27"> The Sanskrit (Reat, p. 32) has <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">śiva</span>, “glorious,” “auspicious,” “propitious,” suggesting that the Tibetan <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">zhi ba</span> might have been a transliteration of the Sanskrit. However, Kamalaśīla (Schoening, vol. 2, pp. 479–480) interprets it to mean “tranquil,” “peaceful.” </note>
            <note index="12" uid="UT22084-062-010-28"> In Tibetan “by nature” could also refer to all aspects listed above; however, in Sanskrit, and according to Kamalaśīla (Schoening, vol. 2, pp. 481–482), it only modifies “never stilled” (<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">avyupaśama­svabhāva</span>).</note>
            <note index="13" uid="UT22084-062-010-29"> The available Sanskrit (Reat, p. 32) for this passage reads: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">anuttara­dharma­śarīraṃ buddhaṃ paśyati| ārya­dharmābhisamaye samyag-jñānād upanayenaiva|</span>. The corresponding section in the Tibetan Degé and other versions recorded in the Pedurma comparative edition read: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">’phags pa’i chos mngon par rtogs te/ yang dag pa’i ye shes dang ldan pas bla na med pa’i chos kyi skur sangs rgyas mthong ngo gsungs so/</span>. The Stok Palace version of the Tibetan differs from the Degé and all other versions recorded in the Pedurma comparative edition; it also more closely reflects the Sanskrit. The Stok Palace (F.284a.4-5) reads: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">yang dag pa’i ye shes thob pas/ ’phags pa’i chos mngon par rtogs pas bla na med pa’i chos kyi skur sangs rgyas mthong ngo gsungs so/</span> (“By attaining right knowledge and thereby realizing the Dharma of the noble ones, he sees the Buddha, the body of the unsurpassable Dharma”). The Tibetan <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">thob pa</span>, “to attain,” is a conceivable rendering of the Sanskrit <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">upanaya</span>, which Reat renders as “exertion.” Kamalaśīla (Schoening, vol. 2, pp. 483–484) interprets this phrase to mean, “Whoever sees dependent arising in this manner sees the Dharma of accomplishment and the Dharma of fruition, because ultimately everything is the same taste, and because the Buddha Bhagavān too is the nature of the body of the ultimate Dharma which was thus taught. Therefore, it is taught that whoever sees the Dharma thus taught sees the Buddha… Whoever comprehends dependent arising thus taught realizes the Dharma of the noble ones; this means ‘comprehending the Dharma of the ultimate meaning.’ Whoever comprehends the Dharma of the ultimate meaning is endowed with perfect wisdom. Whoever is endowed with perfect wisdom abides in the wisdom of equanimity and thus does not perceive any difference between dependent arising, the Dharma, and the Buddha.” The <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa title">Śālistamba</span>[<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa title">ka</span>]-<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa title">ṭīkā</span> attributed to Nāgārjuna (Schoening, vol. 2, p. 393) interprets the phrase as: “ ‘Unsurpassable’ means that that there is no special dharma whatsoever that is superior to this, hence it is ‘unsurpassable.’ ‘Body of Dharma’ means the Dharma-body itself. … ‘Buddha’ is so-called because of comprehending dharma(s). Thus, one who sees dependent arising sees the nature of one who awakens to the unexcelled Dharma, beyond further training.” Akin to the reconstruction presented above in note 7, this phrase on its own carries the semantic range of the Buddha as an embodiment of the unsurpassable nature of “reality” (Dharma), the unsurpassable “doctrine” (Dharma) that teaches it, and the unsurpassable “qualities” of awakening (dharmas) incumbent upon becoming an awakened one (Buddha). Reat (p. 32) translates the phrase as “he sees the unsurpassable Dharma-body, the Buddha, by exertion based on right knowledge in clear understanding of the noble Dharma.” Schoening (vol. 1, p. 241) translates the final section as, “sees the Buddha, the body consisting of unsurpassable dharma(s).” In interpreting “unsurpassable” to modify “dharma,” and not the whole phrase “body of dharma,” we attempt to follow the interpretations of the commentaries and Schoening. We also leave “dharma” untranslated here in an attempt to capture something of the multiple entendre of the term. See Harrison (1992) for observations about possibly earlier, non-metaphysical senses of <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharmakāya</span> and the associated term <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharmaśarīra</span> in Mahāyāna literature. </note>

            <note index="15" uid="UT22084-062-010-32"> The sense of “Dharma” here seems to be both “doctrine” and “reality,” i.e., the “doctrine” as “law” (Dharma), which describes the “true nature” (<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharmatā</span>) of “reality” (Dharma). According to Kamalaśīla (Schoening, vol. 2, p. 487), the phrase functions as a synonym for “true nature” (<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">dharmatā</span>, <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">chos nyid</span>).

Edgerton describes this term, as rendered into Tibetan with the phrase <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">chos mi ’gyur ba nyid</span>, as “the doctrine’s being unchangeably the same.” Kamalaśīla (Schoening, vol. 2, p. 487) has the Tibetan <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">nges par ’gyur ba</span>, and interprets it as, “purely immutable, meaning, one should know that things are dependent on certain specific causes.” Once again, “Dharma” here seems to refer both to the nature of reality and to the doctrine that describes this reality. </note>

Also compare with Schoening (vol. 1, p. 296 n2). Generally, however, the list of items in the Tibetan translation featuring <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">gso ba</span> appears in several Sanskrit Buddhist texts. Sastri (p. 9 n45) refers to such an occurrence in Prajñākaramati's <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa title">Bodhi­caryāvatāra­pañjikā</span> (where it is, however, marked as a quote from a Prajnāpāramitā text) and inserts <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">poṣa</span> based on that. De La Vallée Poussin (p. 79) also inserts <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">poṣa</span>, but does not reference a source. Edgerton, under his entry for <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">poṣa</span> (which he defines as, “person, individuality, soul, spirit”), mentions <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-wy foreign">gso ba</span> as a common Tibetan rendering. He surmises that the Tibetan translation comes from the notion that the Sanskrit <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">poṣa</span> derives from <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">puṣ</span>, “to thrive, nourish,” when it more likely derives from <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="text-sa foreign">puruṣa</span>. </note>
