let $input := "The Blessed One smiled. When blessed buddhas smile, this is what happens: instantly, many different kinds of light rays emerged from the Blessed One’s mouth; they were blue, yellow, red, white, crimson, crystal and silver-colored. The light pervaded boundless and infinite world systems, reaching as far as the Brahma world, then returned and disappeared into the crown of the Blessed One’s head."
